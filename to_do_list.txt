### Cepheus's To-Do List ###
"It's like Trello but 1000x worse!"
This to-do list is structured very specifically, so if your name isn't Avery Juniper Hazel, I *highly* suggest not touching anything here unless I have told you otherwise (DM me!!).
After a large task, there is a priority marker. There are three main priority rankings: high, medium, and low. Priority rankings are declared in parentheses.
Once a task started, the person doing the task will declare their name in square brackets [like this]. Under large tasks, there may be a declaration of a pre-requisite.
This means that you must do a different task first in order to do that task. Under that, there is a short description of what must be done. This may be either a sentence or two, bullet points, or both.

### Add Blocks ### (Varies) [Avery]
- Mayura Signs (0/2)
- Methane Ices (0/15)
- Ammonia Ices (0/5)
- Karcass Stones (0/7)
- Goreslate (0/8)
- Veinstalk

### Fix Tool Repairing ###
Tool repairing is currently broken for some reason. Fix it.

### Finalize Obdurium Hammer ###
The obdurium hammer is meant to be a sideways mace. Code it.

### Add Block Interactions ###
- Water Bottle + #can_become_frigus_mud
- Bonemeal + Frigus Grass

### Add Tags ### (High)
Go through and add tags for each and every block.

### Set Up Worldgen Datagen ### (High)
- Set up configured features
- Set up placed features

### Set Up Crops ### (Low)
- Make a crop block type
- Add Bruma
- Add Azure Root
### Frigus Worldgen ### (High)
- Frigian Plains
- Frigian Forest
- Frigian Glaciers
- Frigian Underground Marsh

### Karnis Worldgen ### (Low)
- Neuron Forest

### Refactor ### (Low)
Go through every file you've done and clean up the code, add comments, and try to make sure a minimal amount of things is done manually rather than through datagen or code.
There are also some other things that you should look out for, such as:
- Falling block particle colors
- Map colors
- Unused or unnecessary code

### Ideas ###
- Azurebread (Gingerbread analog)
- Frigus Cake (name change needed)
- Fiber (String analog) (Bruma around milk)
- Magma Cream + Liquid Nitrogen = Edible Treat
- Cancerous Flesh, which spreads to surrounding flesh like grass does to dirt
- Suit Upgrade: Oxygen Recycling
- Lower Gravity Step Height Increase
